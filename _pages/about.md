My name is Guoqiang Li, coming from Inner Mongolia, China. I am currently an associate professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I received the Dr.-Ing. degree from the University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 2019. 

My research focuses on the intersection of optimization and machine learning, with applications to the safety and security of connected automated driving systems.
