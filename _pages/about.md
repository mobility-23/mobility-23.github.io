Dr.Guoqiang Li is currently an associate professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. Prior to this, he worked as a research scientist in Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) in Singapore, and was a research engineer in Visteon Electronics Germany GmbH (European Research Center) in Germany. He received the Dr.-Ing. degree in the Department of Electronical and Computer Engineering from the University of Kaiserslautern in 2019. Dr.Li's research interest is at the intersection of optimization, control theory, and machine learning, to build advanced mobility systems, develop effective multi-information fusion algorithms, and design sophisticated motion planning and optimal control techniques for connected automated vehicles/robots and intelligent transportation systems to operate safely, efficiently and intelligently in dynamic uncertain environments.
