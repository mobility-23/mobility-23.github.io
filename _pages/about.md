Dr.Guoqiang Li is currently an associate professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. Prior to this, he worked as a research scientist in Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) in Singapore, and was a research engineer in Visteon Electronics Germany GmbH (European Research Center) in Germany. He received the Dr.-Ing. degree in the Department of Electronical and Computer Engineering from the University of Kaiserslautern in 2019. Dr.Li's research interest is at the intersection of optimization, control theory, and machine learning, to build advanced mobility systems, develop effective multi-information fusion algorithms, and design sophisticated motion planning and optimal control techniques for connected automated vehicles/robots and intelligent transportation systems to operate safely, efficiently and intelligently in dynamic uncertain environments.

- Meta-learning based optimal trajectory planning under uncertain condition
  
In the real traffic situation, the complex dynamic environment contains lots of uncertainties, bringing challenges in safe driving. Targeting this, a novel meta-learning-based trajectory optimization approach for safe autonomous driving is proposed to address the uncertainty of environment and obstacle motion. The method leverages meta-learning for the model online adaption and trajectory optimization for active collision avoidance considering the motion uncertainty of multiple obstacles. It can reduce the lateral tracking error by 72.6% and can achieve 100% collision-free for safe driving in complex scenarios involving multiple obstacles under motion uncertainty, providing safety capability for reliable autonomous driving.
