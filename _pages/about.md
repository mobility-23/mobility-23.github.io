- Meta-learning based Optimal Trajectory Planning under Uncertain Condition

In the real traffic situation, the complex dynamic environment contains lots of uncertainties, bringing challenges in safe driving. The changes in internal parameters of the ego vehicle, e.g. mass (from passengers, cargo), tire characteristics (from the load, pressure, temperature), lead to modeling mismatches. Moreover, the uncertain motion of obstacle vehicles can lead to unexpected driving behaviors, posing great challenges in safe driving. Targeting this, a novel meta-learning-based trajectory optimization approach for safe autonomous driving is proposed to address the uncertainty of environment and obstacle motion. The method leverages meta-learning for the model online adaption and trajectory optimization for active collision avoidance considering the motion uncertainty of multiple obstacles. It can reduce the lateral tracking error by 72.6% and can achieve 100% collision-free for safe driving in complex scenarios involving multiple obstacles under motion uncertainty, providing safety capability for reliable autonomous driving. The test video can be found here. ([Viedo](https://youtu.be/Dx5L-fe4lTo))

- Fault Detection and Data-driven Active Fault-tolerant Control for Autonomous Driving

In automated vehicles, the growing number of sensors have increased the system complexity, making the vehicles susceptible to faults. The widely applied drive-by-wire technologies have also brought great demand in the system redundancy. When the vehicle suffers from faults on key components, it may lose stability and cause potential danger during driving without timely full control or effective takeover by human drivers. Therefore, real-time fault detection and active fault-tolerant control on vehicles play significant role to effectively prevent potential accidents and ensure safe autonomous driving. To improve the system stability and safety, a novel data-driven optimal adaptive fault-tolerant control method with model learning is developed for automated vehicles to enable effective and safe driving under various faults. It can efficiently detect both actuator and sensor faults and achieve the highest performance metric. The method realizes effective tracking performance with less lateral error with dynamic model online learning compared to robust control methods, leading to driving safety and reliability. The codes are open-sourced here. ([Code](https://github.com/mobility-23/Fault-Tolerant-Control-System))

- Attack Detection and Secure State Estimation for Localization

For high-level AD particularly level-3 and above, the localization plays a crucial role in the vehicle safe navigation which usually requires centimeter-level positioning. Due to reliance on sensor inputs, the vehicle localization is vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks. Recent results show that GPS spoofing attack has become one main threat,  which is highly critical for safe transportation. To solve the cyber-security problem, a systematic study regarding the security of the localization under GPS spoofing is explored for safe and reliable autonomous driving. The method applies the lateral direction localization from camera and map to detect and defend against advanced GPS adversarial attack. It shows best performance compared to the state-of-the-art detection approaches. The position estimation for attack defense is effective and robust in different driving scenarios, ensuring safe and reliable AD in closed-loop form. This is the first systematic exploration of GPS attack detection and defense approach for connected automated vehicles to improve the driving safety. The test video can be found here.
