In this paper, an ecological adaptive cruise controller (ECO-ACC) for parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in a car-following scenario is presented to improve the fuel economy and to maintain a desired inter-vehicle distance from the preceding vehicle. An ACC based on action dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP) is proposed to obtain an ecological velocity profile and realize an active distance control in normal driving situations. ADHDP is able to adapt internal parameters online and can thus deal with systems with disturbances. Furthermore, an adaptive energy management strategy for HEVs is introduced to control the gear shift and power split for fuel consumption optimization. The gear shift command is designed by enumeration, and the power distribution between the engine and the electric motor is performed by ADHDP. The developed ACC and energy management strategy are finally combined to an ECO-ACC to achieve a multi-objective optimization. Only the current velocity and acceleration of the preceding vehicle are used while knowledge about the future velocity is not needed. The simulations of different driving cycles indicate that the ECO-ACC can lead to near-optimal fuel economy and comfortable driving.
